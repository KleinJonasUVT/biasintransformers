# Quantifying Gender Bias in Dutch Word Embeddings

This repository contains the code and analysis for my Data Science & Society thesis on detecting and quantifying gender bias in Dutch word embeddings. The project leverages LSTM and Transformer models to track gender representation in embeddings, employing SVM-derived gender subspaces to analyze localization and evolution of biases over time. The research uses the SoNaR-corpus.
